This is the official JDBC driver for Neo4j.

This driver was mainly developed by http://larus-ba.it[Larus BA, Italy], a certified consulting and integration solutions partner for Neo4j.
*Thank you* so much for all your work.

[NOTE]
The previous JDBC driver for Neo4j 2.x was moved to the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc-2x repository.

Being a graph database, Neo4j is not serving data in a relational way and the exact purpose of this project is to allow
projects that are using the classic JDBC connector in the relational paradigm to interact with Neo4j.

This driver supports various types of database transports:

* through the Bolt protocol (3.1.x) using `jdbc:neo4j:bolt://<host>:<port>/`
* through the HTTP protocol (2.x+) using `jdbc:neo4j:http://<host>:<port>/`

Going forward there will also be support for:

* direct file connection
* embedded connection

=== Maven dependency

For the all-in-one module supporting both Bolt and HTTP, you can simply use:

[source,xml]
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-jdbc-driver</artifactId>
    <version>{neo4j-jdbc-version}</version>
</dependency>

If you only want one of the protocols, you can depend on its module:

[source,xml]
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-jdbc-bolt</artifactId>
    <version>{neo4j-jdbc-version}</version>
</dependency>

or

[source,xml]
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-jdbc-http</artifactId>
    <version>{neo4j-jdbc-version}</version>
</dependency>

=== Minimum viable snippet

.Run Query
[source,java]
----
// Connecting
try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:neo4j:bolt://localhost", 'neo4j', password)) {

    // Querying
    String query = "MATCH (u:User)-[:FRIEND]-(f:User) WHERE u.name = {1} RETURN f.name, f.age";
    try (PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(query)) {
        stmt.setString(1,"John");

        try (ResultSet rs = stmt.execute()) {
            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println("Friend: "+rs.getString("f.name")+" is "+rs.getInt("f.age"));
            }
        }
    }
}
----
// end::mvs[]

*Please note* that the example above uses the try-with-resource blocks that automatically closes resources when the `try` block is exited.

=== Usage with Neo4j Server

* Install a Neo4j 3.1.x server and start it with the Bolt protocol enabled
* Connect with URLs in the form `jdbc:neo4j:bolt://<host>:<port>/` (e.g. `jdbc:neo4j:bolt://localhost/`)
* You can also use additional comma separated parameters in the URL for authentication, debug mode, SSL encryption and flattening e.g. `jdbc:neo4j:bolt://localhost/?user=neo4j,password=xxxx,debug=true,noSsl,flatten=[-1,100,1000]`

* Add the JDBC driver dependency or jar file to your project
* Get a connection from `DriverManager`
* Execute queries and transactions using the Cypher graph query language

=== Flattening

As most JDBC clients and tools don't support complex objects, the driver can flatten returned nodes and relationships by providing all their properties as individual columns with names like `u.name`,`r.since` if you just return a node `u` or relationship `r`.

This is enabled with the JDBC-URL parameter `flatten=<rows>`, where `<rows>` indicates how many rows are sampled to determine those columns.
With `-1` all rows are sampled and with any other value you determine the number of rows being looked at.

=== Building the driver yourself

First clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc[the repository].

This project is composed by the following modules:

* https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/tree/master/neo4j-jdbc[Neo4j JDBC] - the core module
* https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/tree/master/neo4j-jdbc-bolt[Neo4j JDBC - Bolt] - module supporting the Bolt protocol
* https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/tree/master/neo4j-jdbc-http[Neo4j JDBC - HTTP] - module supporting the HTTP protocol
* https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/tree/master/neo4j-jdbc-driver[Neo4j JDBC - Driver packaging] - module to package all above modules


.Run all unit tests & integration tests

[NOTE]
To run the performance test, you must have a Neo4j Server 3.1.x running with the Bolt protocol enabled on port 7687 (default)
